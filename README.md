# New Here?

So you're very new to Ruby? Good thing you found us!

*We're going to take you on an ADVENTURE!*

![Adventure Time!](/adventure_time.gif)

This project was started to provide puzzles for people pondering programming.
We found that Ruby was pretty welcoming and provides some great tools to get
started in web development.  It's also a beautiful language :-)

We are using a tool called [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) for this
exercise. It is, for our intents, effectively a stripped down version of [Ruby
on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

## How do I get everything setup?

### USE THE CLOUD HARRY!

This guide is written against using Cloud9 as it reduces barriers a lot lower
than a local install. We've followed [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (3rd
Ed.)](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#sec-up_and_running) on this
one.

* Set up a Cloud9 Account: [Cloud9 - Your development environment, in the cloud](https://c9.io/)
* On your dashboard `CREATE A NEW WORKSPACE`
* Click on `Clone from URL`
* Paste this url into the `Source URL` field: `https://github.com/ZachBeta/ruby-newbie`
* Click `Create`
* Prepare to rock!

### Install stuff on your machine

If you are comfortable installing code on your own laptop. Follow the steps in this section
to get a Ruby development environment running on your own machine.  This is an alternative
to using the Cloud9 service described in the previous section.

  * Install Ruby on Rails based on this guide: [Install Rails | Your Guide for Installing Ruby on Rails](http://installrails.com/)
    * We will not be using Rails right now, but the setup is VERY similar.
  * If you're new to GitHub we recommend using one of the links on the right hand side of this page: `Download ZIP` or [download the zip here](https://github.com/ZachBeta/ruby_newbie/archive/master.zip)
  * Unzip into your favorite directory. We recommend a "workspace" directory in your home directory: `~/workspace`
  * Open it in your editor of choice. If you don't have a preferred editor, we like to recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to beginners.

## How do I run it?

Each README will explain how to open and run the smaller applications.

# Some Samples

Simple websites to explore Web Development with Ruby

## Basics
* Hello World
  * `sinatra_hello_world` Hello World website in [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html)
    * Get a basic sinatra webapp running
* Reloading the server automatically
  * `sinatra_with_reload`
    * Dynamically reload the page so you don't need to restart the app
* Dates
  * `sinatra_friday` "Is it friday yet?" website clone
    * Use some Ruby date functions in a sinatra site

## HTML
* HTML template tools
  * `sinatra_template` Serve erb templates
    * Use erb templates with sinatra
* CSS
  * `sinatra_bootstrap` Serve erb templates with twitter bootstrap
    * Use erb templates with css and js assets
* Forms
  * `sinatra_form`
    * Handle simple form behavior with sinatra

## Next Level
* Using libraries
  * `sinatra_quotes`
    * Use the `i_heart_quotes` gem to display a random "quote of the day" page
* Hosting
  * `sinatra_hello_heroku`
    * Deploy a simple sinatra app to a real web server



# What if I run into issues?

File a github issue :-)

There's some very common issues people run into that I'll be updating in this README as they arise.
